        <p>Compact Carbon Capture is a company in need of a website to help them sell their product; "groundbreaking new technology for CO2 capture". My approach was to try and give the site a profile that would capture the company "personality" and the purpose of the product simultaneously.
        <br>
        <br>
        This gave me two interesting contrasts to work with; the contrast between their more conservative, "practical" bearing and demeanor, and the modern and progressive nature of their technology. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Considering these values, the classic combination of blue and orange as complimentary colours seemed appropriate.

        <p>Blue is a colour that has a universally calming effect on us; inspiring feelings of safety and trust. Orange on the other hand, is far more energetic and optimistic, and I chose this to reflect the ambitious desire of spreading a more practical, cost-effective solution for CO2 capture.
        <br>
        <br>
        Orange is also a fairly industrial colour, which also inspired the more silver-hued heading; another colour that will be seen upon most all security gear and garb.
        <br>
        <br>
        The choice of font was made to reflect much the same properties as I meant to communicate with my colour palette: functional but with a modern aesthetic.</p>

    The client was dealing with an international target audience, so I decided for a minimalistic design, which lead me to decide for large background images as a visual element, particularly on the home and technology page. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Since the product itself aims to protect the environment, a clear blue sky seemed appropriate, and a horizon of clouds was intended as a symbol for keeping said skies clear.
    <br> 
    <br>
    Since blue was such a dominant element, I saw fit to provide a call to action: the orange button, directing the user to learn more about the product.

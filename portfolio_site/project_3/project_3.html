        <p>This assignment was to create a website for a fictional company that wants to help organize urban bicycle tourism. This was a project of a few firsts for me: 
        <br>
        <br>
        1) this was our first assignment where we were required to make it entirely responsive - as in; functional on all platforms. 2) this was my first time using a background image as a dominant visual element in the design of a website.</p>

        <p>Given that the overall theme for this site was to be eco-friendliness, the visual design needed to reflect this, and while green was an obvious element, I decided to try and not be too cliche by not making it the -primary- colour. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Instead I chose a warm yellow hue, particularly as the tours would be set in the city, where nature is not so dominant. Thus I wanted to create a more spontaneous, energetic mood to reflect the activity of biking on a sunny day!</p>

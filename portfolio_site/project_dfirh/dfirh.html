            <p>In this assignment, my group and I were tasked with providing "DFIRH" (an organization aiming to help immigrants integrate in the county of Hordaland in Norway). 
            <br>
            <br>
            They required something clean, modern, and easy to use. Lucky enough to find myself in a team with distinct strengths between the three of us, we complemented each other well while creating our site.
            <br>
            <br>
            While my two teammates were fairly specialized in graphics design and coding respectively, I lay somewhere in-between, and as such I could often play mediator when it came to decision-making.</p>

            <img src="../images/dfirh_prototype_sketches.jpg" alt="screenshot of a wireframe sketch for dfirh in adobe prototype XD">
            <p>While we desired to create the best website that we could, this assignment was primarily meant to test our workflow, how organized our work process would be. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Ultimately it was a fairly agile method of working, but we kept daily contact, kept an overview of which tasks needed to be done and who was put to which tasks (thanks Trello!) and maintained a unified and clear vision.
            <br>
            <br>
            We spent a good deal of time in Adobe Prototype XD deciding on a wireframe and visual profile, and remained as faithful to this as was conceivably possible (given that the client wanted the site made in Wordpress). </p>

        <p class="projectText">In the end, though we were faced with unique challenges; unforeseen technical issues and being heretofore unaccustomed with Wordpress as a tool for creating websites, we managed to deliver.
        <br>
        <br>
        I will be eternally grateful for this experience and how it reminded me of the importance of communication, compromise, having a clear game-plan and finding unity in common purpose and vision.</p>

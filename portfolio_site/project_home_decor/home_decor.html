            <p>This assignment entailed creating a website for a fiction home decor shop, with an emphasis on justifying our design choices (font, colour, logo) and taking our own photographs (specifically with mobile) and preparing them for web in Photoshop.</p>
            
            <p>I decided to capitalize on the H and try to make it part of the Logo; emphasizing a contrast of straight lines and a smooth curve; aiming to give associations to sturdiness/reliability but also playfulness and pleasing shapes.
            </p> 

            <p>I chose the three main colours: teal, atomic tangerine and white to play on associations on dependability, warmth, comfort, freshness and newness.

            <img src="../images/home_decor_prototype_shop.jpg" alt="sketches for home decor website - shop page">
            <p>On this website I'm technically using 4 different custom fonts; Iowan Old Style in the logo, Bree Serif for links (both in navigation menu and elsewhere), Raleway for the H2 subheaders and Cardo for body text.</p>

            <p>The font for the logo was "Iowan Old Style" (designed by John Downer and was inspired from serif typefaces from Renaissance Italy), which along with "Bree Serif" and "Cardo" was meant to evoke a sense of history</p>

            <p>I opted for a background image of a living room; appropriate for the product. This particular photo was chosen mostly because the hues on the painting and the light from the lamps on the table proved harmonizes with my own chosen color palette.</p>
        </aside>

        <div class="displayWrapSpecific"><img class="displayImg" src="../images/home_decor_screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot of website"></div>
        
        <div class="projectText">
        <p>The aim was to create a home page which communicated the premise clearly, proved calming and enjoyable to look at but also promised a little bit of adventure while also looking like a dependable, serious business. Overall I think I managed this, though</p> 

        <p>I do think the idea for the fade-in background image didn't translate as well to mobile as I would have liked; I considered a similar fade-in from the top down on the mobile background image, but concluded that the content would extend too far down, and so I instead opted for the "opacity filter"</p>

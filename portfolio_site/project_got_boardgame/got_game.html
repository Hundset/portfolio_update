            <p>Our assignment was to create an online board game based on the HBO tv-series; Game of Thrones. This presented a unique and in many ways exciting challenge, as everything I had worked on up til this point has been a lot more orthodox: CSS and JS for the purpose of “traditional” websites meant to inform and sell the user on a product and/or company.</p>
            
            <p>The rules for the game were already decided: Choosing two player characters from a list of 10 in a “Snakes & ladders” style of game with 30 tiles from beginning to end, a 6 sided dice to generate movement, traps along the way to stall progress, a player getting another turn if they rolled a 6.
            </p> 

            <p>The background image is a piece of fan-art of the Iron Throne, creating immediate associations to the namesake of the source material. Despite the game's rules being inspired by snakes and ladders, I opted for a monopoly style layout in order to keep the throne central.

            <p>I primarily took inspiration from HBO's own sites; (viewer's guide and the fficially licensed browser game). The former's colour scheme was primarily composed of various shades of gray</p> 

            <p>Both in its advertisements and its front page the official browser game presents the throne: one side on fire, and the other frozen in ice - an allusion to the title of the book series - A Song of Ice and Fire.</p>

            <p>Similarly two of my three primary colours be Blue and Red, with a lighter orange used for “highlights”, used as a complementary colour to the Blues but also to contrast with the darker backdrops.</p>

            <p>I chose a less muted colour scheme despite the source material's tone and themes because the site emulates a board game, which are usually colourful to evoke a sense of playfulness and excitement.</p>

        <div class="displayWrapSpecific"><img class="displayImg" src="../images/got_game_screenshot_charselect.jpg" alt="screenshot of website"></div>
        
        <div class="projectText">
        <p>Given that I have some talents/skill in drawing, I was convinced that making my own illustrations would be for the best, even if I'm not very experienced with colouring art. At this point in time I was fortunate enough to have a family member offer to colour my drawings for me, which I chose to accept. Over time we both agreed for the sake of their workflow and meeting the deadline that we would use illustrations they created from scratch - as they found this easier.</p> 

        <p>Aesthetically I'm decently happy with the final result, although information distribution might be a bit too constrained to the left side of the screen. I am most happy with the board itself, with the graphics used for the tile patterns and the icons, I tried to hit a sweet spot with recognizable detail that would remain visible when scaled down to the tiles.</p>

        <p>Given my starting point at the onset of this assignment I'm happy that I managed to get as far as I did and this is certainly progress in my own development. While it revealed at the time that I still have a lot to learn about working in Javascript and writing more DRY and reusable code, I did a lot of learning on the way on this particular project.</p>

        <p>It is for this reason that I choose to showcase this site as a part of my portfolio: the site's design, my work on the logo and icons, to catalogue my progress and to show my willingness to learn and self-reflect.</p>

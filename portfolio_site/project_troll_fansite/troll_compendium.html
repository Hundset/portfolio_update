            <p>I began this project between my first and second year of studying Frontend Development, and later returned to it between the semesters of my second year. The intention was to get in some practice on my own time since the studies took us through a lot of new modules and concepts at once, not leaving a lot of time to linger on singular projects.</p>

            <p>I chose to try and make an unofficial fan-site of something I'm passionate about, in this case to recreate a subsection of World of Warcraft's old site; the "Troll Compendium" (archived <a class="link_external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101107211103/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/story/troll/">here</a>).</p>
        </section>

        <aside>
            <img src="../images/fan_project_screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of 'Jungle Troll tribes' page of fansite">

            <p>A big visual effect I wanted to experiment on this site was to emulate something similar to a parallax effect, albeit in pure CSS (at the time we had not been working in a lot of JavaScript). Please go and check it out!</p>

            <p>The idea was to try and make reading through the content of the site something of a "journey". I found this particularly useful on the "Troll Categorization" and "history" pages; to demonstrate various types of Trolls on the former page and to give a sense of "narrative" in regards to the latter page.</p>

        <div class="projectText">
        <p>Finding the appropriate imagery for this site was a very interesting challenge, as was taking care to be certain where it came from, who the artists were, and to have good and functional links on hand.</p>

        <p>On that note, it was really important to me to give clear information about my sources and providing creditation for every single bit of art and imagery used on this site; noting it both in the code and making a specific "sources" page (to be found <a class="link_external" href="http://www.hundsie.com/troll_compendium_remake/sources_credits/sources.html">here</a>).</p</p>
